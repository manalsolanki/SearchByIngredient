# Search By Ingredient

- The basic idea for the project is, if I search any with the help of ingredients(vegetables) then it would show a list of recipes which can be prepared.

- Here some prerequisite are kept like onion,ginger,garlic are always there whereas pasta noodles are also available. So mainly it is for vegetables.

## About Project

- Keeping in mind the MVP, i have hereby build a small scenario where
    - When we the user inputs 3 ingredients(all Complusory) it will check for combination of any two ingredient present in the recipe then it will be display that name.
    - For example : If for
        - 1st input : carrot
        - 2nd input : corn 
        - 3rd input : pepper
    - So the output will be 3 dishes Sweet Corn Soup, Vegetable lasagna and egetable noodles.
    - As corn & carrot are present in sweet corn soup and carrot & pepper are in lasagna and noodles.

- Current Limitation : The input we are giving should be the same name as mentioned in the code.

- Future Enchancements : 
    - If there is some minor change in the input like carrots instead of carrot then it should take into consideration.
    - Instead of only considering 2 ingredients can consider more.
    - Can add more user Inputs.
    - Furthermore can connec to the Database and store each recipe detail in tables which would help to manage.
